INTRODUCTION


The World Wide Web
It is a collection of webpages.
It is invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee who is a british scientist in CERN to spread scientific discovery to other researchers worldwide.
It is considered to be the greatest information system.

The World Wide Web was based in these three (3) core technologies:
HTTP
HTML
URL

Hypermedia
one document that contain link to other documents.

2 Kinds of Resource:
Static Resource – The resources already exist in the web server.
Dynamic Resource – Resource that is produced on the fly.
(ex. Google image search)

    WWW plays one of two roles. Either server which provides functionalities / server application.

Application
web servers (hosting or storing)
wait connection of clients
web client (browser)

Webservers
Hosting or storing of web resources
Waits for clients to request those resources.

Web crawler (a.k.a Web Spider)
This application crawls the web and harvests information

Inter-Network
    Internet - global network
    inter - across boundaries
    network - establishing a connection (interconnection)

HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol

an application layer communications protocol used to access resources (hypertext / hypermedia) on the world wide web

invented by TimBerners-Lee at CERN 1989

jointly developed by W3c and IETF(Internet Research Task Force)

is stateless

Physical Layer
Highest Layer (application layer)
    E.g: browsers (chrome) / webserver (apache)

Bandwidth Hog
sending large chunk of data
Solution: chunk it up to “packets”
