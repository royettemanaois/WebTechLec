INTRODUCTION


The World Wide Web
It is a collection of webpages.
It is invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee who is a british scientist in CERN to spread scientific discovery to other researchers worldwide.
It is considered to be the greatest information system.

The World Wide Web was based in these three (3) core technologies:
HTTP
HTML
URL

Hypermedia
one document that contain link to other documents.

2 Kinds of Resource:
Static Resource – The resources already exist in the web server.
Dynamic Resource – Resource that is produced on the fly.
(ex. Google image search)

    WWW plays one of two roles. Either server which provides functionalities / server application.

Application
web servers (hosting or storing)
wait connection of clients
web client (browser)

Webservers
Hosting or storing of web resources
Waits for clients to request those resources.

Web crawler (a.k.a Web Spider)
This application crawls the web and harvests information

Inter-Network
    Internet - global network
    inter - across boundaries
    network - establishing a connection (interconnection)

HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol

an application layer communications protocol used to access resources (hypertext / hypermedia) on the world wide web

invented by TimBerners-Lee at CERN 1989

jointly developed by W3c and IETF(Internet Research Task Force)

is stateless

Physical Layer
Highest Layer (application layer)
    E.g: browsers (chrome) / webserver (apache)

Bandwidth Hog
sending large chunk of data
Solution: chunk it up to “packets”

2 Kinds of Resource:
Static Resource – The resources already exist in the web server.

	WWW plays one of two roles. Either server which provides functionalities / server application.

Application
web servers (hosting or storing)
wait connection of clients
web client (browser)

Webservers
Hosting or storing of web resources
Waits for clients to request those resources.

HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol

an application layer communications protocol used to access resources (hypertext / hypermedia) on the world wide web

invented by TimBerners-Lee at CERN 1989

jointly developed by W3c and IETF(Internet Research Task Force)

is stateless

Physical Layer
Highest Layer (application layer)
	E.g: browsers (chrome) / webserver (apache)

Bandwidth Hog
sending large chunk of data
Solution: chunk it up to “packets”


HTTP support for other functionality
Cache controls
Content media type (MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) spec
What resource is sending
Language and character set specification
Specify the language English in ASCII
content/transfer codings compression
Content negotiation
Client - Server protocol negotiation
Switch protocol for specific transfer
Persistent connection (ex. 400 transfer in one page)
Request pipelining
Authentication or authorization

OSI Model (7 layers)
retrieve web resources
Send http request message to the server

HTTP 0.9(1991)

HTTP 1.0 (1996)


-GET, HEAD, POST

HTTP 1.1 (1999 -2014)
persistent connection(HTTP keep-alive) – Keep-alive connections allow the client and server to use the same TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests and responses. (3 way handshake)

HTTP 2
-comes from GOOGLE SPDY-
-Heading compression
-Server push to lessen the page
-pipelining request - allows the requests responses to be split into chunks and be returned in an intermingled fashion so avoiding head of line blocking.
-transfer of data(optimized)

FUNDAMENTAL
- HTTP typically runs on top of TCP/IP using TCP port by default or TCP port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)

IANA is a department for ICANN
IANA – a department responsible for coordinating key elements to keep the internet run smoothly
	- allocate and maintain codes and numbering system that are used in technical standards that drive the internet
-Domain Names
-Number Resources
-Protocol Assginment

SERVERS
-origin servers
-proxy servers, gateways, tunnels

CLIENTS
-aka user agents (UA)
-web browsers, web crawlers/spiders, other user tools and application

HTTP resource are identified using URL

Components of URL for HTTP(or HTTPS)
Scheme


Host
A domain name (resolved to an IP address using DNS) of the server where the resource reside or will be created
Path
Resolved relative to the document root on the server
May refer to a static or dynamic resource
Query
Start with ? (ex ?id=12234)
Typically provided as key=value pairs, with (&) separates between key/value pairs (ex.?size=M&color=red)
It maybe URL-encoded
Fragment Identifier
Refer to a bookmark
Only part not sent to the server
HTTP Request
